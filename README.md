# Arkanoid -- #SQN
This is a working Arkanoid/DxBall Clone project (unfinished, more about it at the end) . 

It's in C++ and uses the [SFML] library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to draw the objects (version 2.4) .

How to get started with SFML: [SFML Tutorials] .

[Visual Studio Community] was used for this project, and we recommend it (it's free) .

The code itself has comments, but are all in Portuguese (Portugal), that will be changed in the future(maybe) .

### About the GAME itself
* It only has "one level" (pictured above)
* You can either play it by yourself or let it play by itself ("[B]ot" option)
* You can speed up or down the ball by pressing respectively "I" or "O"
* The game maintains a scoreboard with all the scores made in the game, but only displays the Top 10

### About the CODE itself
Like it's said on the top, it's kinda incomplete, here is the list of what's missing or needs to be changed:
* Change comments from Portuguese (Portugal) to English
* Make the correct conversions between variables (because of warnings)
* Automatically size and position drawn text by using the resolution size (mostly done, some need fixing)
* Verify everything that is allocated and de-allocate respectively (some missing)
* Clean the code itself at the end
